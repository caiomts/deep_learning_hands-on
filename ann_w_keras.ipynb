    "* ANN's frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex problems;\n",

    "A **Perceptron** is composed of a single layer of TLUs with each TLU connected to all inputs (when all neurons in a layer are connected to every single in the previous layer, the layer is called a *fully connected layer* or *dense layer*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs of the Perceptron are fed to special passthrough neurons called input neurons: they output whatever input they are fed. In addition, an extra bias feature is generelly added ($x_0=1$), it's represented using a neuron called *bias neuron*, which outputs 1 all the time.\n",

    "Hebb's rule: The connection weight between two neurons tends to increase when they fire simultaneously\n",

    "A variant of the rule takes into account the error made by the network when making a prediction. **The Perceptron learning rule reinforces connections that help reduce the error**.\n",

    "$\\eta$ is the learning rate.  \n",

    "The decision boundary of each output neuron is linear, so Perceptron are incapable of learning complex patterns. However, if the training instances are linearly separables the algorithm would converge to a solution (*Perceptron convergence theorem*)\n"

    "**The backpropagation** training algorithm in short is a Gradient Descent using an efficient technique for computing the gradients automatically. In just two pass through the (one forward and one backward), the backpropagation algorithm is able to compute the gradient of the network's error with regard to every single model parameter. In other words, it can find out how each connection weight and each bias term should be tweaked in order to reduce the error. Once it has there gradients it just performs a regular gradient descent step, and the whole process is repeated until the network converge to the solution.\n",

    "* Compute how much each output connection contributed to the error (chain rule) and how much of these error contributions come from each connection in the layer below and so on until reaches the input layer. This measures the error gradient across all connection weights in the network by propagating the error backward (**backward pass**).\n",
    "* Finally the algorithm performs a Gradient Descent step to tweak all connection weights in the network using error gradient computed.\n",
